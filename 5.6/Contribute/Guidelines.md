# GitHub Controbution Guidelines

In this document you'll see the controbution guidelines. This has to be used in order to have the pull request added to the main branch of this site. Please review all sections to make sure you follow those guidelines.

## Detail

You need to add details. The Unreal Engine docs don't do this too well in some spots and is very annoying to most people due to lack of clarity. Make sure to document the file name, what to add, refrences, anything crucial to what is being explained.

## Pictures

Please add pictures, this is important because Unreal Engine has stuff everywhere depending on each person. Adding picures will help readers understand where you're trying to navigate them to.

### Picture Sources

You must provide the images yourself, having these images in one spot will make displaying the images much easier. You can either save an image and that as for the image you're going to use or do it yourself and make all the screenshots. You're not allowed to have any images that go outside of this repository.

## Unreal Version

Please check your version of Unreal Engine before commiting to these docs. Make sure you're on the version specified in the tag next to the 'Unreal Docs' title in the top left. If you aren't on the matching version of the editor then your request will not be accepted, that's why when making a pull request you must specify your engine version, if your engine is from the launcher or from source, and if you have any external development kits such as the Game Development Kit (GDK).
