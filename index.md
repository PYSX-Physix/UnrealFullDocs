# Welcome

This is an unofficial Unreal Docs website. Some pieces of this documetation will be taken from the official docs but some will be original.

## Why are we doing this?

We are doing this because Unreal Engine is not well documented and with every new version of Unreal Engine, the plugins/features are changed in some way and is not updated in the Unreal Engine Documentation. We plan to keep this documentation up to date with the latest version of Unreal Engine and make sure everything is accurate to allow people to reliably use this documentation.

## How Can I Help?

This project is completely open source and the GitHub Repository is available [here](). You're able to contribute to this project to make this documentation more complete. If you'd like to learn how you can contribute to this documentation project you find out more in the [contribute](/Contribute/Contribute.md)
